    "# Conclusiones\n",
    "Resumen del experimento\n",
    "\n",
    "Se compararon tres configuraciones sobre el prompt “To be” con máx. 30 tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelo original (baseline) con muestreo simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelo mejorado (mismo backbone) con nuevas estrategias de decodificación (greedy y top-k/top-p).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelo MoE (mixture of experts) con decodificación greedy y top-k/top-p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tamaño de modelos:\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline: ≈109.952 parámetros\n",
    "\n",
    "MoE: ≈309.000 parámetros\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidencia (salidas observadas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline (muestreo simple): To beyousThe en is 'drem yourch wel\n",
    "→ Coherencia limitada; mezcla de palabras semisintéticas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mejorado – Greedy: To be the the the the the the the t\n",
    "→ Degeneración repetitiva típica de greedy en modelos pequeños.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mejorado – Top-k + Top-p: To beno the the and ant and the he\n",
    "→ Aumenta diversidad, pero persiste ruido sintáctico/semántico.\n",
    "\n",
    "MoE – Greedy: To be!RGe:!Ab?aCimJPSx!AxpRr yAQv'P\n",
    "→ Salida gibberish marcada (símbolos/mezcla aleatoria).\n",
    "\n",
    "MoE – Top-k + Top-p: To beQsFArQAb?? onirS?DOm&RbFpqpvnv\n",
    "→ También gibberish, aún con muestreo estocástico.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretación técnica\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelo pequeño + corpus pequeño → techo de calidad bajo.\n",
    "Con tan pocos parámetros, el lenguaje fluido sostenido es difícil; los decodificadores “sacan jugo”, pero no inventan capacidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy en tiny LMs tiende a colapsar en bucles (“the the the…”).\n",
    "Es esperable y sirve solo para tests/reproducibilidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-k / Top-p mejoran diversidad, no necesariamente coherencia.\n",
    "En modelos chicos, top-p≈0.9 o top-k≈30 suelen ser el mejor trade-off, pero la base sigue limitada.\n",
    "\n",
    "MoE no mejoró las salidas y produjo ruido severo.\n",
    "Aunque el MoE aumentó capacidad (≈3× params), probablemente:\n",
    "\n",
    "No tuvo entrenamiento suficiente/estable para aprovecharla.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gating sin balance/regularización → colapso o rutas erráticas.\n",
    "\n",
    "La versión académica que evalúa todos los expertos y luego mezcla no ahorra cómputo y puede aprender mezclas pobres si el LR/regularización no acompañan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnóstico probable para el MoE\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrenamiento insuficiente (pocas épocas/steps) para 3× parámetros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gating sin aux-loss de balanceo → un experto domina o el ruteo queda “ruidoso”.\n",
    "\n",
    "LR demasiado alta para la nueva arquitectura.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenización y objetivo: si es a nivel caracter o con vocab corto, el MoE exacerba la entropía sin guía.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recomendaciones concretas\n",
    "\n",
    "Decodificación para demo: usar temperature≈0.8 + top-p≈0.9 o temperature≈0.8 + top-k≈30 (no ambos a la vez).\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-entrenar el MoE con:\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-1 routing (K=1) al inicio;\n",
    "\n",
    "LR más conservadora (p.ej., 0.5× del baseline) y más pasos;\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout moderado en expertos (ya lo tenés) y weight decay suave;\n",
    "\n",
    "Aux-loss de balanceo (si lo pueden agregar) para repartir carga del gating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Métrica de informe: reportar val_loss y Perplejidad = exp(val_loss) de baseline vs MoE (mismo split).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semillas + checkpoints para comparar corridas; si hay inestabilidad, aplicar gradient clipping y AMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusión\n",
    "\n",
    "La estrategia de decodificación impacta notablemente: greedy colapsa; top-k/top-p ayudan, pero el límite lo impone la capacidad del modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "El MoE no mostró ventajas en este régimen: más parámetros sin entrenamiento estable generaron salidas peores (gibberish). El enfoque tiene potencial pero requiere ruteo disciplinado, más pasos y/o regularización para superar al denso.\n",
    "\n",
    "“En modelos tiny, la decodificación controla el estilo pero no reemplaza la capacidad. El MoE exige entrenamiento y balanceo para aportar beneficios; de lo contrario, empeora la calidad generativa.”"
